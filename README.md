</a>

## How to use ?
- You only need the main.ipynb file
- Run each cell sequentially.

<i>If you are using VScode instead of colab, change the first cell to the following : </i>

```
#pip install tensorflow tensorflow-gpu opencv-python mediapipe sklearn matplotlib
```
Basically change the exclamation to a pound.

I personally think the existing model is an overfit mess, but I don't have energy to train it again.
